fun-spaces
==========

Little projects exploring alternatives for describing spaces in Scala.

Currently the projects are configured to work with Scala IDE. I will eventually migrate one or both to SBT, but not right now. If you have problems getting the code to work, keep in mind that there are very few files. It is probably easy to create a new project and import the files. As I said, I will do that with a SBT project eventually.

Have fun!
